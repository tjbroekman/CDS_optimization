# CDS_optimization

This repository contains python models and optimizations for my master thesis project titled: "Designing an optimized closed electrical distribution system for a multi-carrier energy hub on a mixed-use area in Hilversum"

The main optimization function runs in the notebook CDS_gurobi_linearized_optimizer_final. The sequential model of the energy system is found in CDSmodel_RUNFILE.
Further functions and calculations are spread out over the rest of the python files and python notebooks.

If any questions arise please contact me on: simiobr@hotmail.com
